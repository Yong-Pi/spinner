# Spinner API Documentation   {#index}

Welcome to the Spinner's API documentation! Spinner is a motor control firmware
based on the Field Oriented Control (FOC) principles. The firmware is built on
top of the [Zephyr RTOS](https://zephyrproject.org), a modern multi-platform
RTOS. Spinner is still a proof of concept, so do not expect production grade
stability or features.

Some of the offered features are:

- FOC based current control loop
- Driver APIs for:

  - Current sampling
  - SV-PWM
  - Feedbacks (e.g. Halls)

These pages contain documentation for all the APIs used in the Spinner
firmware. For more details on the Spinner architecture, refer to the contextual
documentation pages.
